## About
Convert a text document such as `.txt`, `.md`, or `.html` into meaningless and 
intentless text. This retains all other information in the document such as 
layout and attributes but replaces the body with lorem ipsum.

### Use Case
This is intended for scenarios where a document needs to be shared with
another party but it's not desireable to share the content of the document,
but rather the styles, layout, or anything and everything else but the content.

The prime example in mind, and our use-case is bug-reporting;
as it can be important to provide an example of a particular type of document
that produces a bug however not desireably to give the real content of the
document that caused it. This provides a swift way to strip the document
of all meaning and intent and make it easy to share with others.
